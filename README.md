## The Gatsby, Contentful, Netlify Stack at CPOSC

This is a repo with code from my talk! Note, this won't run locally for you. It needs:

- A `.env.development` repo with a `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` specified. (And likewise needs a `.env.production` file to build.)
- To be connected to a Contentful space ewith the expected structure and data.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions from my talk!
